<h3 align="center" >Description</h3>
This project contains the source files to that should run a Card Game with a graphical user interface. The card game deals a random set of five cards to each player and the house, where each player can win a round by having a higher card value sum than the house. When a player wins they double the bet they placed prior the round's initiation. This project was an assessment in my first year of university, where I received full marks (100%).
